# Notebooks

This folder is a suggested place for exploratory work with your Excel data.

Example ideas:

- `01_exploratory_excel.ipynb` — Inspect raw sheets, value distributions,
  and potential data quality issues before running the full pipeline.
- `02_post_migration_checks.ipynb` — Connect to the SQLite database and
  explore the resulting tables.

Jupyter notebooks are intentionally not committed here by default; generate
and save them locally as needed for your workflow.
